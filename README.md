### Harry's Vertex Weight Exporter
##### Version 2.0 (for blender 2.8x and up)

Simply download this git repo as a .zip open blender, and select "Install addon"
in addons from the preferences menu. 

##### How do I link up these weights with the vertices?

This file exports the vertices in the same order as obj files exported by
blender, so no extra work is needed to link weight to vertex

**Note** that this exporter normalizes vertex weights so they add up to 1.0
as required by my game engine
